# Introduction
This repo contains a [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) infographic that visualizes [SOSE](https://www.sose.it/)'s data on waste 
disposal in Italian municipalities ("Comuni") in Italian ordinary statute regions in 2010 and 2013. 
Specifically, this interactive visualization shows expenses and forecasted expenses per region/province (users can interactively choose what they want to see).
Users can click on individual circles (municipalities) to explore SOSE's data on municipalities.
